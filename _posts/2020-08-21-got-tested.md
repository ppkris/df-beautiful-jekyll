I got up early at 7 in the morning and took 172 at the usual bus stop around 7:38 am with an unusual mood. 
Coincidentally, youyou was taking the same bus and I waved to her, sitting before her without conversation 
during the trip. I got off on 58th street while it was still 40 minutes early. The 
curbside testing clinic is right opposite to the American School building with no body showing up so I found 
a bench nearby to sit where I can see clearly how things going on at the check in place. At around 8:15, I 
saw cars stopped at the check in tent and nurses started to go through ID checks. I was wondering where can 
I get tested since I don't have a car. I waited, waited until about 8:25 and then approached to the tent asking 
the nurse how can I get tested and she indicated me to get into the building for check-in. I turned around and 
saw a door behind the big curbside testing tent with a sign saying "No driver check in". Actually, I did not go 
straight into the building because I just saw an old lady went in there and since only people with symptoms can 
get tested so I wanted to wait until she gets out. I wandered a little bit outside the building, seeing another 
young lady with casual clothes wearing a mask seemingly sick go into the building. I was thinking "Oh, I 
can't wait for too long otherwise more people are going to get in" meanwhile the old lady went out while blowing 
her nose. Actually I was pretty paranoid in my mind that I was even reluctant to walk through the hall 
way that she just went past. Finally I got in and the nurse checked my name, my date of birth and then guide me to 
sit in the waiting area keeping social distance with other "patients". After about 5 minutes a nurse called my 
name and took me to a triage room. She gave me a brief introduction of the test and checked my date of birth again. 
The test was conducted with my mask pulling off to just expose my nose. I felt a little sour on my throat when 
she poke the long cotton stick into my nose and spin around. Right after she pulled it out, I can't help but make a 
sneeze and that sneeze made me paranoid again because what if the prior sick patient got a sneeze too and the virus is 
till in the air while I got off my mask making a big sneeze. Would that cause me infected? "Oh, no" I cried in my 
mind but I can do nothing about it. I was still worrying if they would make mistakes about my identity so I asked her 
if my name was showing right on the label. The nurse was very kind and showed me the label.  
<br>
The imagination that the air was polluted by the sick looking young lady drag me into another round of anxiety attack. Am 
I psychologically too fragile? I always ask myself. Four days ago, I was scared myself out by meeting a lady talking 
in the elevator without wearing a mask. Three days ago, I was close to try puking after knowing to have a rotten tomato may 
cause problems. Hope these are just normal reactions during this abnormal period.  
<br>
Hope I can get my test result back soon and safely got on to the plane. By the way in order to not let airline staff 
question my test result or even reject me on board I asked youyou to help me print the 7 pages introduction of the cobas 
assay. What makes me so paranoid like this? Am I just overreacting or is it the reality?
