# Thoughts about my future projects

Today is the first day of my last month in Chicago.  
I love this place.  
It seems I don't have any concrete projects done, yet I know for myself that 
I learned a lot, especially machine learning.  
One of the difficulties in ML is sometimes it is hard for it to implemented in real life projects.  
At first I thought they are all doing prediction projects and I don't want to follow other people's step.  
I want to be "creative", be "innovative", or even be "revolutionary" 
but one thing I am wrong about that is I forget the most important concept "Gradient Decent".  
I tell myself that I need to start with small steps so for now the small step is to create a prediction model 
in our cardiac surgery clinical setting. I need to do my best to set up the model to solve some clinical issues 
in a practical way.

## Just keep going with small steps as machines does with gradient decent.
