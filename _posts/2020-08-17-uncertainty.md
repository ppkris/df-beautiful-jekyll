I talked with Aunt Jianli and Jim via WeChat yesterday as a farewell. I told them I have experience the 
warmth of family while in the US with them in Erie and via all those chats 
and I would arrange a family dinner back in Shanghai to let the warmth revive which I miss so much 
here, in particular during this abnormally special period.  
<br>
As Jim said in the video chat, I am facing a great uncertainty. First of all is if the Covid test result 
would allow me to be on board the charter flight back home. Second, I just hear the property manager of Regents 
Park would charge a ridiculous fee after we move out even if we have cleaned room and they would find excuses that 
can be exaggerated and put a chunk of penalty on tenant so I cleaned the room for a whole day and only half is done. 
Now there pops out the third, the car I planned to take for sending me to the airport on Tuesday may be unavailable. 
I sold the car to her and asked her to drive me to the airport as a prerequisite for selling but she said she is afraid 
of driving on the high way and did not reply my message for a whole day today so I guess there is a high likelihood that 
I can not depend on her promise and I need now to consider my second option. Thus, everything seems messed up that makes 
unable to focus. I can not even read a simple reuters article not to mention think about my project or read papers. 
Hope tomorrow will be fine.  
<br>
I would really like to thank my Aunt Jianli who said if I miss the plane I can go to her place to stay and don't make 
myself homeless. Thank you Jianli and Jim. All is well.
